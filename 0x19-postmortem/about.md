Postmortem: When the Load Balancer Went Rogue







Issue Summary
Duration of the outage: June 3, 2024, 11:00 AM - 12:30 PM (PST) Impact: Our e-commerce platform took a siesta, leaving 80% of users in checkout purgatory and 20% staring at blank product pages. Root cause: The load balancer decided to play favorites after a software update, causing server overload.
Timeline
11:00 AM: Detection - Monitoring alerts screamed "Error!" at us.
11:05 AM: Initial Response - On-call engineer rushed in, suspecting a traffic spike. Tried adding server instances.
11:15 AM: Misleading Path #1 - Assumed a DDoS attack. Applied rate-limiting (to no avail).
11:35 AM: Realization - Rate-limiting didn't help; network team called in.
11:45 AM: Discovery - Network team uncovered the misbehaving load balancer.
12:00 PM: Resolution - Rolled back load balancer settings. Servers sighed in relief.
12:15 PM: Verification - Monitored system. All clear.
12:30 PM: Closure - Back to normal. High-fives all around.


Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause: The latest update to our load balancer came with a surprise feature: "Let's Overload Some Servers!" The misconfiguration caused traffic to pile up on a few unlucky servers.
Resolution: Rolled back to the previous load balancer settings. Traffic resumed its even flow, servers relaxed, and users could once again shop without obstacles. The misconfigured setting was identified and corrected for future updates.
Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements:
Enhance pre-deployment tests for load balancer settings.
Beef up monitoring to spot traffic distribution issues faster.
Keep a meticulous change log for load balancer configurations.
Tasks:
Revise load balancer testing procedures (by June 10, 2024).
Implement advanced monitoring for server load and traffic patterns (by June 12, 2024).
Establish a rigorous review process for network configuration changes (by June 15, 2024).
Conduct training sessions for the engineering team on new protocols and tools (by June 20, 2024).

Closing Thought
Who knew a load balancer could be so dramatic? Let's make sure it sticks to balancing and leaves the drama to our marketing team.
