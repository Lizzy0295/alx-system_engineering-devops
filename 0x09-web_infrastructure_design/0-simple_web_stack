1.A server is a device, a virtual device or computer program or providing functionality for devices, called “clients”. 

2.The domain name is used to locate and access resources on the internet.

3.The “www” in www.foobar.com is a subdomain.

4.The web server, in this case, Nginx, plays a crucial role in handling HTTP requests from clients (web browsers) and delivering web content.

5.The application server is responsible for executing the dynamic code that powers the website’s functionality.

6.The database serves as the storage and management system for the website's data.

7.The server communicates with the user's computer using the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) protocol over the internet.


Issues with this infrastructure:


1.Single Point of Failure (SPOF):this infrastructure has a single server, any hardware failure, software issues, or any other disruptions, the entire website becomes inaccessible.

2.Downtime during Maintenance: deploying new code or performing maintenance activities. this leads to downtime during the maintenance window, where the website becomes temporarily inaccessible to users.

3.Limited scalability: Without horizontal scaling capabilities, the website may experience performance degradation or even downtime during traffic surges.
