1. Load Balancer (HAproxy):
  a.Added for distributing incoming web traffic evenly across servers to improve performance and reliability.
   
  b.Configured with Round Robin distribution algorithm, directing requests to each server in sequence.
   
  c.Implements an Active-Active setup, where all servers actively handle requests simultaneously.
   

2. Database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster : Manages website data and ensures data integrity, implementing a Primary-Replica cluster to distribute workload and provide redundancy.


a. Primary node: Accepts write operations and replicates data changes to replica nodes.


b.Replica node: Provides read-only access, replicating data from the primary node to ensure redundancy and scalability.


Issues with this infrastructure:


a.Single point of Failure(SPOF): if there is only one load balancer in the setup and it fails, all incoming traffic will be disrupted.

b.If either the web server or the application server experiences downtime, users won't be able to access the website.


Security issues:


No Firewall: without a firewall, the infrastructure is vulnerable to various types of attacks and malware injections.

No HTTPS: The lack of HTTPS encryption means that data transmitted between users and the website is not secure. 

No Monitoring System: the lack of monitoring system in place,to detect and address performance issues or security breaches will be challenging.
