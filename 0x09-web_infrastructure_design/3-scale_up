Load-Balancer (HAproxy Cluster): The load balancer is added to distribute incoming web traffic across multiple servers. 

Web Server, Application Server, and Database Server (Split Components): 

Web Server: Handles HTTP requests from clients and serves static content directly. 

Application Server: Executes application logic, processes dynamic content, and interacts with the database.

Database Server: Stores and manages application data, providing persistent storage and ensuring data integrity.

HAproxy Load-Balancer Configuration as a Cluster: Configuring HAproxy as a cluster provides high availability and fault tolerance.
