1. **Firewalls:**
   - Added for enhanced security by controlling incoming and outgoing network traffic, preventing unauthorized access, and filtering out potential threats.


2. **HTTPS Traffic:**
   - Traffic served over HTTPS to encrypt data exchanged between clients and servers, ensuring confidentiality and integrity.


3. **Monitoring:**
   - Used to observe performance, availability, and security of the infrastructure in real-time, helping to identify and troubleshoot issues and ensure smooth operation of the website.


4. **Data Collection by Monitoring Tools:**
   - Monitoring tools collect data by deploying monitoring agents or clients on each server, continuously gathering information.


5. **Monitoring Web Server QPS (Queries per Second):**
   - To monitor web server QPS, configure the monitoring tool to track incoming HTTP requests and calculate the rate at which they are processed by the server.


Issues with this infrastructure:


a.Terminating SSL at the Load Balancer Level: Once SSL is terminated, data is transmitted in plain text within the internal network. If an attacker gains unauthorized access to the internal network, they can intercept sensitive data.


b.Single MySQL Server Capable of Accepting Writes: If this server goes down or experiences issues, write operations will fail, leading to data inconsistency and potentially causing downtime for the website.


Servers with All the Same Components: this might lead to an issue of
Lack of resource optimization, Limited fault isolation,Reduced flexibility and scalability.
